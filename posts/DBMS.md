# What is a DBMS and what are the advantages and disadvantages

DBMS - database management system e.g. MySQL

> a tool that allows you to define the underlying aspects of your database, such as the data definition language or the query language.

The **advantages** of using a DBMS, rather than writing programs to access the database directly, include:

-   Data independence – applications are not exposed to data representation or storage details.
-   Efficient data access – does not rely on good programmers.
-   Data integrity and security – enforces integrity constraints.
-   Data administration – single point of administration.
-   Concurrent access and crash recovery.
-   Reduced application development time.

The **disadvantages** of using a DBMS include:

-   Complexity – a DBMS is a complex piece of software.
-   Size – require a substantial amount of space to run (both storage and RAM.)
-   Cost – big mainframe systems can cost over $100,000, or even as much as $1,000,000 for bespoke systems1 **–** plus all come with yearly maintenance costs.
-   Performance – if you opt for a cheaper general purpose system, then there may be runtime overheads which affect performance.
