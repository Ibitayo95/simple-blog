Other than sounding like an alien robot, it is actually quite interesting how tranformer neural networks have taken the AI universe by storm in the past couple of years. After finding out that GPT-3's model was based on this architecture, I wanted to do a little bit more digging.

## What is a Transformer Neural Network (in english)?

A transformer is a type of deep-learning model which is used in natural language processing and computer vision. They are used in these fields because these models are great at tracking the relationships between different data points such as words or pictures and therefore can understand the meaning behind them by learning what the current context is.

Before transformers arrived, users had to train neural networks with large, labeled datasets that were costly and time-consuming to produce. By finding patterns between elements mathematically, transformers eliminate that need, making available the trillions of images and petabytes of text data on the web and in corporate databases.

In addition, the math that transformers use lends itself to parallel processing, so these models can run fast.
